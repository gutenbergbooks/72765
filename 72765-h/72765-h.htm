<h2 class="nobreak" id="FOREWORD">FOREWORD</h2>
</div>


<p>On my Fiftieth Birthday (Sunday,
September 22, 1918), after a good day’s
work, I start, in the afternoon, to spend
the few hours before our evening meal
in writing down some ideas that may help
others (besides myself, who need them as
much as anyone, since I am beginning my
second half-century), to indulge less in
that habit of fear, worry, resentment, and
hurry, which must be regarded as a form
of suicide, slow indeed, but working in
a vicious circle and with self-increasing
force, and poisoning and paralysing others
besides the respectable offenders themselves.</p>

<p>The chief remedy is—keep happy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span></p>

<p>We have had our attention so fixed on
prohibitions—the “Thou shalt not” Commandments—that
we have, as a Nation,
ignored the positive commandments of
the Old and New Testaments; among
which a very frequently repeated one was
“Rejoice” or “Keep Happy.” Others,
besides the Master, told us not to worry,
not to be afraid, not to be angry, not to be
bitter; but to be glad and happy. The
orthodox should remember that Happiness
is a virtue, however unusual, and
Non-Happiness a sin, however common
and respectable.</p>

<p>I give one quotation alone—though the
usual translation does not convey the real
force of the Greek words of Philippians iv.
4-7:—</p>

<p>“<i>Rejoice in the Lord always: and again
I say, Rejoice.... The Lord is at hand.
Be careful (anxious) for nothing; but in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
everything by prayer and supplication
with thanksgiving let your requests be
made known unto God.</i>”</p>

<p>C. D. Larson’s book, “Just be Glad,”
was on my table, and gave me the thought
of writing on this subject. Larson offers
capital ideas on the mental side, but he
does not tell people <i>how</i> to be glad; and,
especially, he leaves out all the Physical
Helps.</p>

<p>In this little Birthday offering, I shall
include a few Physical as well as Mental
Helps—a few out of many, since space is
limited—so that readers may be able to
keep happy easily.</p>

<p>The art is not new, but—like the habit
of deep, full, rhythmical breathing—is
always needed.</p>

<p>There are millions who have scarcely
begun to recognise, at least to the extent
of acting upon the facts, that, while their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
Happiness itself depends largely upon
their digestion, their elimination of waste
matter, their circulation, etc., these influences
themselves depend largely on (1)
the choice of foods and drinks, the way of
eating and drinking, the breathing and
other exercises, and so forth—and on (2)
the maintenance of Happiness itself, or
at least the avoidance of worry and resentment,
etc., and the expression of Happiness,
until Happiness actually is attracted
and comes into a prepared nest.</p>

<p class="ph3">Why Keep Happy? A Contrast</p>

<p>First work out the contrast. Before
reading further, think what happens when
one keeps the opposite of happy, whatever
be the actual stage between the extreme
homicidal or suicidal violence or suicidal
melancholia on the one hand, and, on the
other hand, ordinary fear, worry, resentment,
depression, grumpiness, and so on.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Those who wish to study the effects of
these states of mind more fully, can consult
Elmer Gates’ “The Mind and the
Brain,” or William S. Sadler’s “Physiology
of Faith and Fear,” both quoted
in my book.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> Professor Elmer Gates, of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
the Smithsonian Institute, Washington,
says:—</p>

<p>“<i>My experiments show that irascible,
malevolent, and depressing emotions generate
in the system injurious compounds,
some of which are extremely poisonous;
also that agreeable, happy emotions generate
chemical compounds of nutritious
value, which stimulate the cells to manufacture
energy....</i></p>

<p>“<i>If an evil emotion is dominant, then
during that period the respiration contains
volatile poisons, which are expelled
through the breath and are characteristic
of these emotions.</i></p>

<p>“<i>Wearisome, unpleasant memories
weaken health, and do not generate
thought energy. Cure is accomplished in
expelling these by another crop of wholly
pleasant memories, which put the necessary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
structures of the mind in systematic
order and teach the patient how to use the
mental faculties.</i>”</p>

<p>Therefore, keep happy.</p>

<p>On page 40 of “Economy of Energy”
will be found a summary of some results of
states of mind:—</p>

<p>“<i>They affect</i>:—</p>

<p>“<i>The heart, and the circulation—both
its rate, and its distribution of blood; (unfavourable
states of mind tend to anaemia
or dysxmia, or to congestion, etc.).</i></p>

<p>“<i>The actual chemical condition of the
blood and the lymph.</i></p>

<p>“<i>The lungs, and the rhythm and the fulness
of the breathing, and the amount of
oxygen inhaled, and of carbonic acid gas,
etc., exhaled.</i></p>

<p>“<i>The digestive and ‘assimilative’ organs
and functions.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span></p>

<p>“<i>The curative energies of the body;
which include:—</i></p>

<p>“<i>The excretory organs—the bowels,
kidneys, skin, etc. (Thus fear may act
as a diuretic.)</i></p>

<p>“<i>The muscular system in general (as
when it is paralysed by fear—for instance,
when one feels ‘all of a tremble’).</i></p>

<p>“<i>The appearance—the attitude, the
position of the organs, the expression of
the face, etc.</i></p>

<p>“<i>The voice—its tone and timbre, and
the words used or repressed.</i></p>

<p>“<i>The nervous system—partly influenced
indirectly by the altered breathing,
and by the blood, and by the effects of
the state of mind upon the Solar Plexus.</i></p>

<p>“<i>The energy and endurance.</i></p>

<p>“<i>The poise, and ease of self-mastery,
self-recovery, and self-direction.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span></p>

<p>“<i>The brain—the clearness of thought,
etc.</i></p>

<p>“<i>The influence of the person on others—especially
in the immediate neighbourhood.</i></p>

<p>“<i>The direction and bias of the mind in
the future, states of mind tending to become
habitual apart from the active will.</i>”</p>

<p>Therefore, keep happy.</p>

<p>“Anxiety (which includes fear) saps
more life in a day than work does in a
week.” Anxiety is unnecessary, unproductive,
destructive work. It is hard
work. It is sinful work.</p>

<p>We must remember how prevalent are
the states of mind in which fear is one of
the factors. For fear is a factor in worry,
and usually even in anger, and in depression.
These words from M. J. M. Hickson’s
“Healer” are worth reading:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span></p>

<p>“<i>We have very seldom reflected upon
the fact that fear runs like a baleful thread
through the whole web of our life from beginning
to end. We are born into the
atmosphere of fear and dread, and the
mother who bore us had lived in the same
atmosphere for weeks and months before
we were born. We are surrounded in infancy
and childhood by clouds of fear and
apprehension on the part of our parents,
nurses, and friends. As we advance in
life, we become instinctively, or by experience,
afraid of almost everything.
We are afraid of our parents, afraid of
our teachers, afraid of our playmates,
afraid of ghosts, afraid of rules and regulations
and punishments, afraid of the
doctor, the dentist, the surgeon. Our
adult life is a state of chronic anxiety,
which is fear in a milder form. We are
afraid of failure in business, afraid of disappointments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
and mistakes, afraid of
enemies, open or concealed; afraid of
poverty, afraid of public opinion, afraid
of accidents, of sickness, of death, and unhappiness
after death. Man is like a
haunted animal, from the cradle to the
grave, the victim of real or imaginary
fears, not only his own, but those reflected
upon him from the superstitions, self-deceptions,
sensory illusions, false beliefs,
and concrete errors of the whole human
race, past and present.</i></p>

<p>“<i>Fear not only affects the mind and the
nervous and muscular tissues, but the
molecular chemical transformations of the
organic network, even to the skin, the hair,
and the teeth. This might be expected of
a passion that disturbs the whole mind,
which is represented or externalised in the
whole body.</i></p>

<p>“<i>How does fear operate upon the body<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
to produce sickness? By paralysing the
nerve centres, especially those of the vasomotor
nerves, thus producing not only
muscular relaxation, but capillary congestions
of all kinds. This condition of
the system invites attack, and there is no
resilience or power of resistance. The
gates of the citadel have been opened from
within, and the enemy may enter at any
point.</i>”</p>

<p>Therefore keep happy.</p>

<p>First because, once again, non-happiness
is a mistake. It acts, as I said just
now, in a vicious circle, increasing itself.
It poisons the blood, and this very poisoning
tends to produce more non-happiness.
It radiates itself, and is infectious. It
inclines to become a fixed and sub-conscious
habit. It sinks down into the sub-conscious
self, and afterwards expresses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
itself in various ways which (as Psychoanalysts
show) are not usually associated
with their true mental cause. It is toxic,
and produces non-health and non-efficiency,
by wasting power and force; by
bringing fatigue; by encouraging bad
sleep; by injuring the whole body; by
cramping the energies; by “distracting”
the body and mind, and thus hindering
concentration; by impeding the circulation,
and the elimination of waste-matters;
and by upsetting the rhythm and the deepness
and thoroughness of the breathing,
and all the vibrations of the physical system.
Besides, it is ugly. It militates
against financial success, and against
social success—for who wants a non-happy
acquaintance?—and against intellectual
success.</p>

<p>Consider this. Non-happiness is liable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
to make one’s work poor and inferior, difficult,
tiring, and wanting in foresight and
in perspective.</p>

<p>It does not help. As Ian Maclaren
said:</p>

<p>“<i>What does your anxiety do? It does
not empty to-morrow, brother, of its sorrow;
but ah! it empties to-day of its
strength. It does not make you escape
the evil; it makes you unfit to cope with it
if it comes.</i>”</p>

<p>Therefore, keep happy.</p>

<p>On the moral and ethical side, non-happiness,
especially in the form of worry, is
cowardly, unbalanced, against moral consistency
and persistency, against self-control
and self-mastery, and very unkind to
others.</p>

<p>Therefore, keep happy.</p>

<p>Non-happiness shortens life, and brings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
premature, incompetent, burdensome old
age.</p>

<p>It is selfish, in the worst sense of the
word; for there is a selfishness that is
altruistic.</p>

<p>It harms posterity, as—among other
proofs—we see from the influence of a
mother upon her babe before as well as
after birth.</p>

<p>It makes us less independent and less
free. Therefore, keep happy.</p>


<p class="ph3">How Happiness Helps</p>

<p>Happiness, by the “expulsive power” of
a positive state of mind, drives out or
neutralises or cancels non-happiness, instead
of the mind being left open to the
seven other devils, as it may be when we
merely try not to be non-happy. The
happy heart is too full for non-happiness,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
as the light room is too light for darkness.
As Mr. A. Knight says, Happiness fills
the heart with its three companions,
Health, Harmony, and Helpfulness.</p>

<p>Therefore, keep happy.</p>

<p>Happiness works in the opposite of the
vicious circle. It makes for greater happiness.
It is self-increasing. Among
other reasons, it purifies and invigorates
the blood, and this in itself inclines the
mind towards further and greater Happiness.
It creates the habit of Happiness,
the bias towards Happiness. It stores
the memory with Happiness, for future
use. Prospectively, Happiness must be
valued as a great asset.</p>

<p>Therefore, keep happy.</p>

<p>Happiness does not merely aid in removing
mental and physical Non-Health,
in such forms as depression and fear,
“nerves” and their troubles, fatigue, sleeplessness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
or bad sleep, bad circulation, congestion,
and so on. It actually produces
positive Health, Well-being, and Fitness,
as well as increased Self-Healing and
“Preventive” Power.</p>

<p>Therefore, keep happy.</p>

<p>Think of the letter E alone. Happiness
tends to Health, in its various aspects:—</p>

<p>Enjoyment of life and of all that life
brings us;</p>

<p>Energy—for Health gives a tonic without
reaction;</p>

<p>Economy—for, when we are happy, we
need neither drugs nor stimulants nor
narcotics nor holidays; Happiness saves
vast stores of precious power, both physical
and mental;</p>

<p>Endurance—what long hours we can
work when we are happy;</p>

<p>Ease;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span></p>

<p>Efficiency;</p>

<p>Therefore, keep happy.</p>

<p>Happiness brings the right vibrations
throughout the mind and body, partly
through the Solar Plexus and the Sympathetic
Nervous System. Only lately
have we begun to realise the importance
of the rate and character of vibrations.
Let the same elements vibrate differently,
and we have ice or water or steam. We
know the full and elastic firmness and resilience
of faith, the shrunken and paralysed
trembling of fear. It is largely a
difference of vibrations. Happiness has
the most desirable vibrations.</p>

<p>Happiness means that we inhale more
life-giving and cleansing oxygen, and exhale
more carbonic acid and other waste
matter.</p>

<p>Happiness means that we have better
sleep, and can do with less sleep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span></p>

<p>Happiness means improved circulation.
It keeps the body warm in winter and cool
in summer. It relieves the physical heart.</p>

<p>Therefore, keep happy.</p>

<p>Happiness gives better looks. It
makes the eyes brighter, the complexion
clearer, the step more vigorous, the carriage
more upright.</p>

<p>And, generally, Happiness makes
people more attractive. It has a marked
social value.</p>

<p>Therefore, keep happy.</p>

<p>Financially, Happiness pays. The
happy salesman or saleswoman is more
persuasive. The happy person gets and
keeps more friends, who will like to help
him, if only because his Happiness helps
them. James Coates says:</p>

<p>“<i>Smile at your business, and it will
smile back. Follow the light of that
smile.</i>”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span></p>

<p>Therefore, keep happy.</p>

<p>Intellectually, Happiness helps us to
see with surer clearness and foresight.
Happiness helps us to solve our problems
rightly. Happiness gives us more understanding
and more intuition. Happiness
makes us more receptive to the best ideas.
Happiness puts us in better perspective.
Happiness, once again, increases our
mental energy, endurance, ease, and
effectiveness.</p>

<p>These quotations from C. D. Larson are
excellent. He says:—</p>

<p>“<i>Just be glad, and you always will be
glad. You will have better reasons to be
glad. You will have more and more
things to make you glad.</i></p>

<p>“<i>When you are tempted to feel discouraged
or disappointed, be glad instead.
Just be glad, and your fate will change.
Know that you can be glad, say that you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
will, and stand uncompromisingly upon
your resolve. When things are not to
your liking, be glad nevertheless, for the
glad heart can cause all things to be as we
wish them to be. When things do not
give you pleasure, proceed instead to
create pleasure in your own heart and soul.</i></p>

<p>“<i>It is the law that all good things will
sooner or later come and be where the
greatest happiness is to be found. Therefore,
be happiness in yourself, regardless
of times, seasons, or circumstances.</i></p>

<p>“<i>It is the man who blends rejoicing with
his work who does the best work. It is
profitable in every way to learn to be glad.</i></p>

<p>“<i>The happier you are over what has
come to you, the more and the more will
come to you in the future. The glad heart
and the cheerful soul always make things
better.</i></p>

<p>“<i>Give gladness to your mind, and you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
give clearness to your mind; and a clear
mind can see how to evolve better plans.</i>”</p>

<p>In the moral and ethical and spiritual,
as in the intellectual and financial and
social spheres, Happiness is a precious and
integral factor in success and progress.
We might almost say that Happiness includes
the much-praised virtues of Courage,
Persistence, and Poise, and goes far
towards Self-Control and Self-Mastery.</p>

<p>Therefore, keep happy.</p>

<p>It is kind to others to keep happy.
Happiness tends to Forgiveness (not of
the usual perfunctory and “I-forgive-but-I-can’t-forget”
type), Goodwill, and
pleasant Warmth as of the sunshine.</p>

<p>Therefore, keep happy.</p>

<p>Happiness tends to the right sort of
Youthfulness—the Youthfulness in which
we have all the merits of “little children,”
together with the wisdom of elders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span></p>

<p>Therefore, keep happy.</p>

<p>Happiness makes our life longer—not
like the life of an aged person who may
be a burden upon the earth, living in name
only, and almost as a vampire lives, but a
life of increasingly-useful length.</p>

<p>Therefore, keep happy.</p>

<p>For Happiness is non-selfish.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>But non-selfishness, after all, is a negative.</p>

<p>Happiness does indeed include negative
merits, but it is also positive and radiating
and infectious. When we ask what we
can do for others, one answer is, we
can keep happy. Here, again, Larson’s
words are to the point:—</p>

<p>“<i>He who is always glad is always
adding to the welfare of every member of
the race. The great soul is always in
search of ways and means for adding to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
the welfare of others. But no way is
better, greater, or more far reaching than
this. To be glad at all times is to be of
greater service to mankind than any other
thing we can do. Consider how all things
change when the glad soul arrives, and
how all work becomes lighter when the
spirit of joy is abroad. And every man
has the power to dispense the spirit of joy
wherever he may work or live.</i></p>

<p>“<i>Work in the spirit of joy, and your
work will be the product of joy—a rare
product—the best of its kind.</i>”</p>

<p>Therefore, keep happy.</p>

<p>To help all those with whom you live,
and many beyond this narrow circle, keep
happy.</p>

<p>To help your children and posterity,
whether you already are or are going to be
a father or mother, keep happy.</p>

<p>The relation of a parent (or of any one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
who has charge of children) to children,
illustrates well how our states of mind react
upon ourselves. Be happy with children,
and you make them happier,
healthier, pleasanter to be with, easier to
train. When they are in this favourable
condition, you yourself, in turn, have more
Happiness and health, partly because
your work is more delightful and more
successful. And so your Happiness is
self-increasing as well as self-radiating.</p>

<p>C. D. Larson, from whose book I have
already quoted, says, in another book:—</p>

<p>“<i>Make it a point to be happy, just as
you make it a point to be clean, to be presentable,
to be properly dressed, to work
well, to be efficient. Make the attainment
of continuous happiness and greater happiness
a permanent part of your strongest
ambition.</i>”</p>

<p>Real Happiness is a power within oneself,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
not dependent on circumstances; at
least not dependent when it has become
a habit. He who has Happiness is like
a magic plant that bears beautiful and
shade-giving and health-giving leaves,
beautiful and sweet-smelling flowers,
beautiful and refreshing and cleansing
fruit, wherever it is, and without the aid
of special soil, air, light, warmth, and rain.
For it has, as it were, its own subtle,
ethereal, and eternal soil and air and light
and warmth and rain within itself.</p>

<p>Therefore, keep happy.</p>

<p>The Gospel of Happiness—the word
“Gospel” once meant “good news,” but
now has lost much of its gladdening vitality—is,
when we examine deeply and
widely, “perspectively” and prospectively,
sound Philosophy and sound Religion.
To the devout Hindu, God is not only
“Wisdom, Love, Might,” but also Bliss.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
Sat Chit Ananda meant Lasting Reality,
True Knowledge, and Blissful Happiness.
A Perfect God—and this applies
whether we believe in a Personal Being or
not, for an Impersonal Being cannot
easily be imagined as sad!—cannot surely
be sad; and we are told to become perfect
as God is Perfect.</p>

<p>We are often recommended to fill the
mind with healthy, invigorating, purifying
thoughts. This, again, is a New Testament
Commandment. The words in the
ordinary rendering of Philippians, iv. 8,
do not bring out the vitality and force and
verve of the Greek words, but they give
the general idea:—</p>

<p>“<i>Whatsoever things are true, whatsoever
things are honest, just, pure, lovely, of
good report; if there be any virtue, and if
there be any praise, think of these things.</i>”</p>

<p>It is a Commandment to attend to—to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
fill the mind by repetition with—eternally
true ideas, ideas that command respect,
ideas that are right, ideas that are clean
and pure, ideas that are welcome and
sweet; ideas that have words of good
omen, ideas of manliness and womanliness,
ideas of praise and appreciation.</p>

<p>Therefore, think of Happiness: keep
happy.</p>

<p>In keeping happy, we obey the frequently
reiterated Commandment to “Rejoice,”
and, without any special attention
to the negative and prohibitive Commandments
not to worry, and not to be angry,
and not to be unkind, and not to criticise
unkindly, and so forth, we, <i>ipso facto</i>,
obey these Commandments as well, just
as the person who is encouraged and inspired
does not need to be comforted in
so-called “misfortune.”</p>

<p>Therefore, keep happy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span></p>

<p>Happiness helps you. “It is profitable
in every way to learn to be glad.”</p>

<p>Happiness helps yourself and others,
and hurts none.</p>

<p>“<i>No selfish heart can really be glad.</i>”</p>

<p>Happiness is the right thing to keep.
Happiness is our duty, and is “good
form.”</p>

<p>Happiness increases itself.</p>

<p>“<i>The more things you are glad for, the
more things you will have to be glad for.
Gladness is a magnet. Because you were
glad, even when there was nothing to make
you glad, you proved that you deserved
everything that has the power to make you
glad. And that which we truly deserve
must come to remain as our own. Possess
gladness, and you will soon possess those
things that produce gladness.</i>”</p>

<p>But how?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span></p>


<p class="ph3">How to Keep Happy</p>

<p>It is so easy to say to others, or to ourselves,
Keep happy. But <i>how</i> keep
happy?</p>

<p>Here are a few out of many helps.</p>

<p>People will ask, “What about trying
circumstances? How can we keep happy
under, or in them, whether they be past or
present or future?”</p>

<p>I was much struck by a phrase in a little
book I read some time ago. It described
how someone, who was going to an unpleasant
interview, was told:—“Go to the
man, taking God with you.” A good
piece of general advice is to welcome the
circumstances as one would welcome either
a strong opponent or a severe handicap at
a game—namely, as a privilege and an occasion
for bringing out (as a great player
said) “one’s best game.” I think a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
“handicap” is an excellent description.
For what true sportsman resents a handicap?</p>


<p class="ph3">Turn the Mind to Blessings,</p>

<p>or think of your own blessings, not only in
the past, but also in the present. Think
of all the conveniences of civilisation.
Then, if you like, contrast the hardships of
primitive times—with no books, no travelling
facilities, no sanitation!</p>

<p>Think of blessings, and keep happy.</p>

<p>Think of the blessings of others. Anything
is better than giving attention to
supposed injuries and hardships, and to
sorrows, and resenting or bemoaning
them.</p>


<p class="ph3">or to Reasoning</p>

<p>When things seem amiss, then is <i>the</i>
time to give all your thoughts the upward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
direction. Keep happy. Hold on to
Happiness, not like grim death but like
irrepressible life.</p>

<p>Remember that “everything serves
<i>some</i> useful purpose.” If you refuse to
keep happy, at least determine to find out
the useful purpose. But, as soon as you
can, come back to yourself, and keep
happy.</p>


<p class="ph3">Help Others</p>

<p>Help others. This is the old and ever
new way. As Maeterlinck says:</p>

<p>“<i>Before we can bring happiness to
others, we must first be happy ourselves.
Nor will happiness abide within us unless
we confer it on others. If there be a smile
upon our lips, those around us will soon
smile too; and our happiness will become
the truer and deeper as we see that these
others are happy.</i>”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span></p>

<p>Therefore, keep happy by helping others.
We can help others by our thoughts—by
wishing them to be well and happy
and successful, or by imagining them to be
well and happy and successful. We can
help them by all our expressions—our
words, our looks, our acts—and by our
very abstinence from non-happiness.</p>


<p class="ph3">Abstain from Thoughts against Others
and against Self</p>

<p>Merely to send out no thoughts and to
harbour no thoughts against other persons
or things, or against ourselves, is a
step in the right direction. I once saw
hornets destroyed by a man who stood
over the nest and, as each hornet came
out, knocked it down and killed it by
a blow from a little wooden bat. So we
can beat down any undesirable thought—of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
worry or failure or resentment, etc.—so
that it ceases to live and poison us or
others.</p>

<p>But still this is negative. It is not
positive and constructive. To keep
happy, we must fill the glass, drop by
drop, with the sparkling and fresh water
of Happiness; and then the dirty water
will automatically trickle away, and—who
knows?—somehow become a kind of
mental manure and fertiliser.</p>


<p class="ph3">“Self-Suggestion”</p>

<p>Self-Suggestion is a great help, if we
would keep happy. We can tell ourselves
to keep happy, in the same way as Peter
Latham, at a hard and critical point in
one of his Professional Championship
Matches, kept not only happy but also
plucky by telling himself to “buck up,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
as this was <i>the</i> chance to bring out his
best game!</p>

<p>Self-Suggestion has many forms and
varieties. Henry Wood, in his “Ideal
Suggestion Through Mental Photography,”
advises us to write down inspiring
“Self-Suggestions,” and to look at
them often. Leland, in his “Have You a
Strong Will?” advises us to determine, the
last thing at night, that the next day we
will, for example, work calmly and easily
and successfully. I myself find that now
one form of Self-Suggestion is most
effective, now another. It may be Imagination
or Realisation or Assertion, or it
may be a quiet order to the Servant Mind
or Manager Mind, or it may be a strongly-felt
and repeated Desire, or it may be
nearer to Silence and Receptivity, together
with “the attitude of expectancy.”</p>

<p>Self-suggestion is feasible at all times<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
and in all places. It is unobtrusive. It
is “without money and without price.”
It is effective. It tends to become a sub-conscious
habit, and, as it were, to “do
itself” without our attention.</p>

<p>To keep happy, we can use happy
words. Words have vast and little appreciated
power. Think how useless we
should be as regards our power of controlling
ourselves and helping ourselves
and helping others, if we had no words!
It would be easy to write a long book on
this aspect of the Art of Happiness, alone.
But I must be content with just one idea.</p>

<p>We should speak with a cheerful voice
and tone, as well as with a cheerful face;
and we should prefer, to such words of ill
omen as “miserable” and “cruel,” words
that end rightly, such as un-happy and un-kind—words
that leave us with the right
and happy notion. Conversely, however,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
when we are—or think that we are—absolutely
obliged to mention some unpleasant
episode, in order to get others to
help to put it right, we must <i>not</i> use such
vivid expressions—we must not speak
whiningly nor even keenly. This is preeminently
the occasion for such a monotonous
and expressionless voice, as is unusually
put on by a Secretary when reading
the minutes of any previous meeting!</p>

<p>Can we not speak of pleasant things
with the excitedness of the French, if indeed
we wish to be excited at all; but speak
of unpleasant things, if we feel we must
speak of them, with the apathy of the
Hindu?</p>

<p>When you have finished any Self-Suggestion,
be sure to keep happy.</p>

<p>To keep happy, we must use Repetitions
of Self-Suggestions and of Happy
Words, and we must use them long before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
we seem to need them. In place of the old
adage, “In time of peace prepare for
war,” one can substitute, “In time of peace
prepare for victory”—and then there will
be no real war.</p>


<p class="ph3">Persistent Repetitions</p>

<p>The persistent Repetitions may be in
the form of sheer repetitions; or in the
form of Synonyms—such as Happiness,
Gladness, Enjoyment, Joy, Welcome; or
in the form of cognate words, words that
suggest not so much Happiness itself, as
the father and mother, the brothers and
sisters, the sons and daughters, of Happiness.
Thus, to take the letter P alone, it
has a decided effect upon our feelings of
Happiness to repeat, with as much attention
to and realization of the idea and the
inner spirit and soul of each word, as possible,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
the words Purity, Poise, Peace,
Plenty, Power, Pluck, Pleasantness.</p>

<p>As to the influence of Repetition, we
must remember that we are mainly what
our sub-conscious mind is; and our sub-conscious
mind is largely what our conscious
mind has chosen or allowed itself to
think, and what our conscious mind every
moment—every now—is choosing or allowing
itself to think.</p>

<p>Or, instead of repeating the ideas themselves
or the words that can convey them,
we can keep happy by Reason and Argumentation.
While an Assertion like
Robert Browning’s,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“God’s in His Heaven,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All’s right with the world,”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>will help some, a recalling of the advantages
of Happiness—or of the disadvantages
of Non-Happiness—and a working<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
out of the ways in which the past
“failures” of ourselves and others turned
into blessings, will help others. I remember
how disappointed I was when I did not
get a Fellowship at Cambridge. I am
now very glad that I did not. What
seemed a calamity led to my present work,
which enables me to keep happy. As a
fossilised Don I should not have kept
happy!</p>


<p class="ph3">Appreciation and Welcome</p>

<p>We should go far towards keeping
happy, also, if we practised Appreciation.
We breathe fresh air, drink pure water,
see glorious scenery, or architecture, and
so forth, without a tithe of the proper enjoyment
which would come from the
proper valuation—for instance, of the
water as refreshing us, satisfying us, helping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
our assimilation of nourishing food,
helping our elimination of toxic waste
matter, and symbolising much besides.</p>

<p>It is far better to approach any persons
or things or circumstances that are ours—they
would not come to us, or we to them,
unless they were ours!—in the spirit of
Welcome, and in the true and sporting
Play Spirit, than in the spirit of discontent.</p>

<p>So keep happy by Appreciation.</p>


<p class="ph3">Laugh</p>

<p>Some people have a genius for seeing
the funny side of so-called “misfortunes,”
like the Chinaman who could not control
his laughter, just before his execution, because
they were going to hang the wrong
man. In a little booklet called “Fifty
Years not Old,” I wrote:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span></p>

<p>“<i>Laughing is a capital relief for unpleasant
mental states, as well as fine exercise
for the stomach and liver! Democritus,
the laughing and smiling philosopher,
may have carried his excellent principle
to excess; but he was a safer guide
than the weeping and moaning philosopher.</i></p>

<p>“<i>It is worth while to collect cartoons
and cuttings from the ‘Daily Mirror,’
‘Punch,’ and other papers, and to look
through them when the dumps try to dominate.</i>”</p>

<p>Laughing and smiling can come under
muscular control, no less than walking and
sitting—no less than frowning and
grumbling. We can tense or relax
muscles. We can equally easily laugh or
smile. And the mere muscular action will
help the mind and the feelings to be free
from non-happiness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span></p>

<p>There are, of course, wrong kinds of
laughter and smiling. I read a book devoted
almost entirely to the abuse of
laughter and smiling. But the right
kinds are as valuable as they are rare.</p>

<p>Several people that I know have the
supreme art of making troubles almost
blessings by catching at once the ludicrous
aspect—going round to the other side and
seeing things from a different approach.
And sometimes, entering into the trouble
by the Gate of Humour, they find
that the trouble is not a torture-chamber
but a factory of Success and Happiness.</p>

<p>The right laugh and smile is an expression
of real Faith; and, as we have seen,
the expression, if persevered in, tends to
bring the reality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span></p>


<p class="ph3">The Power of Imagination</p>

<p>And keep happy by Imagination.
How exhilarating it is to imagine oneself
succeeding in one’s favourite game, or in
one’s business or art or hobby. Such
imagination is far better than the memory
of defeats, except in so far as the latter
helps us to correct our faults.</p>


<p class="ph3">The Power of Expression</p>

<p>Then there is the Art of Expression,
advocated by Delsarte and William
James. The latter, in his “Talks on
Psychology,” may not be strictly accurate
and scientific, but at any rate he is practically
useful, when he says:</p>

<p>“<i>If we only check a cowardly impulse in
time—for example, or if we only don’t
strike the blow or rip out with the complaining<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
or insulting word that we shall
regret as long as we live—our feelings
themselves will presently be the calmer
and better, with no particular guidance
from us on their own account. Action
seems to follow feeling, but really action
and feeling go together; and by regulating
the action, which is under the more direct
control of the will, we can indirectly regulate
the feeling, which is not.</i></p>

<p>“<i>Thus the sovereign voluntary path to
cheerfulness, if our spontaneous cheerfulness
be lost, is to sit up cheerfully, to look
round cheerfully, and to act and speak as
if cheerfulness were already there. If
such conduct does not make you soon feel
cheerful, nothing else on that occasion can.
So, to feel brave, act as if we</i> were <i>brave,
use all our will to that end, and a courage-fit
will very likely replace the fit of fear.
Again, in order to feel kindly toward a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
person to whom we have been inimical, the
only way is more or less deliberately to
smile, to make sympathetic inquiries, and
to force ourselves to say genial things.
One hearty laugh together will bring
enemies into a closer communion of heart
than hours spent on both sides in inward
wrestling with the mental demon of uncharitable
feeling. To wrestle with a bad
feeling only pins our attention on it, and
keeps it still fastened in the mind: whereas,
if we act as if from some better feeling, the
old bad feeling soon folds its tent like an
Arab, and silently steals away.</i>”</p>

<p>An equally good quotation (from
Luther Gulick’s “Mind and Work”) will
be found on pages 26-27 of “Economy of
Energy.”</p>

<p>He says:</p>

<p>“<i>Assume the bodily positions and movements
and manners and tones of voice that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
belong to the emotional state you desire.</i>”</p>

<p>Now the Expression—as the smile that
is the expression of Happiness—may not
be the cause of Happiness, but at least it
is the usual accompaniment, if not the
essential accompaniment, of ordinary
Happiness.</p>

<p>The eyes are among the most obvious
means of Expression, as is illustrated in
the well-known lines:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">“<i>Smile, once in a while,</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>’Twill make your heart seem lighter;</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>Smile, once in a while,</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>’Twill make your pathway brighter.</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Life’s a mirror: if we smile,</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>Smiles come back to greet us;</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>If we’re frowning all the while,</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>Frowns forever meet us.</i>”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The whole face is a part of our Expression—not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
only the eyes, but also the
mouth, and the lines, which are largely
under the ultimate control of the will,
through the control of the muscles.</p>

<p>And there is the whole attitude of the
body, the up-holding of the chest and the
head, the correct curve of the spine (so as
to bring the position of “mechanical advantage”
and physical and nervous economy),
the deepness and fulness and
rhythm of the breathing, the laugh, the
song (sung aloud or “sung silently”),
and the tone and the “tune” and the timbre
of the voice.</p>


<p class="ph3">Uses of Odd Moments</p>

<p>What we seldom realise is that, no less
than we can move our biceps, we can move
our muscles that regulate our Expression.
If people can spend 15 minutes daily over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
a dull—and often almost useless, if not
actually stiffening and harmful—grinding
series of spring-grip dumb-bell exercises,
why will they not spend a few moments
at some one time daily, or many (otherwise
wasted or misused) moments at frequent
intervals throughout the day, in
exercising the muscles that regulate their
Expression—in lifting up their heart (and
chest and head) and in laughing or smiling,
so as to keep happy?</p>

<p>Besides the Expression, as an easy avenue
to Happiness, there is another—rather
less easy—avenue in the improvement
of the state of the Health in general,
and the state of the Blood in particular,
through more sensible Foods and Feeding,
Drinks, Water-treatments, and Exercise
and Exercises—especially Breathing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span></p>


<p class="ph3">Various Avenues to Better Health</p>

<p>Some principles and details will be
found in various books.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> There is no
space here for more than a few suggestions.</p>


<p class="ph3">Better Foods and Drinks</p>

<p>Years ago, the late Dr. Forbes Ross
told me that, when he was medical superintendent
of a certain Asylum, he found
that the patients were very violent on
Thursday afternoons. On Thursdays, at
the mid-day meal, they had Beef-Extract.
He forbade this, and at once the Thursday
afternoon violence ceased. In my own
case, the depression of years ceased when
I gave up flesh-foods and meat-extracts
more than 23 years ago.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span></p>
<p>This does not mean that such foods are
a cause of non-happiness in all cases.
Still less does it mean that they are the sole
cause, or even the main cause, in all cases.
Many haphazard “vegetarians” have been
miserable.</p>

<p>It rather means that some better Diet
may be an important factor in Happiness.</p>

<p>The general idea of Diet, for producing
or increasing mental and physical Well-Being,
which includes Happiness, would
surely be to get first such a régime as shall
clear out the clogging and depressing or
irritating toxins and waste-matters, and
shall not add to them, but shall re-build
a clean and healthy body and mind by a
better <i>Balance</i> of the various Food Elements.</p>

<p>The Drinks, in order to increase the
Well-Being and the subsequent Happiness,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
should be cleansing, and should include
the minimum of undesirable elements
(whether overstimulating, or narcotic).</p>

<p>There is no need here to explain how
Food and Drink affect the mind. We all
know some of the depressing effects of
“Liver,” Indigestion, Constipation, etc.,
and the partial dependence of these
troubles on the Food and Drinks. But
few who have not studied the subject as
I have been enabled to do, thanks partly
to my work with the leading Clinical
Analytical Expert, Mr. C. H. Collings,<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a>
could guess how some of the most common
and respectable errors of Food and Drink—such
as excess of starchy and sugary
stuff, of fruit, of tea or coffee or cocoa, and
so on—can produce non-Health and consequent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
Non-Happiness, partly by affecting
the Brain and the Solar Plexus
through tissue-storage of toxins and
Toxœmia or an acid and poisoned bloodstream.</p>

<p>There are thousands who imagine that,
because most of their “civilised” acquaintances
regularly take certain meals as a
matter of course, therefore these meals
must of necessity be “all right”; not knowing
that Nature does not withhold from
us her results according to Law—often
called her “punishments”—merely because
large numbers of other individuals
are making similar mistakes! To be
orthodox in life is not the same thing as to
be immune from the effects of orthodox
mistakes.</p>

<p>I could show letter after letter that tells
how, beside better Foods and Drinks,
simple Water-treatments, and various<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
Exercises have tended to Health and
Happiness. There are Exercises (like
those in “Economy of Energy,” pp. 79,
83, 86, 87, 90, 94, 97) which help improve
the Position of the body, the fulness and
the rhythm of the Breathing, the economy
of the muscles, by Relaxing and so forth.
There are Stretching Exercises, Foot-Exercises,
Trunk-Exercises, Athletic Exercises,
and so on.</p>

<p>But one or two items must suffice here,
as mere examples of how attention to
physical acts may influence the state of the
mind.</p>


<p class="ph3">Better Position; Better Breathing; Less
Muscular Tension</p>

<p>1. When the heart and lungs and
stomach are sunk and sagged down, there
is a tendency to mental as well as to physical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
“depression.” The right Exercises<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a>—quite
simple and easy—will draw the
organs up into their normal place again,
and thus will help to remove “the dumps”
and bring Happiness.</p>

<p>2. Happiness has its own type of
Breathing (as shown by the Pneumograph
and the registering cylinder-drum) quite
different from the type when there is fear
or anger. If we establish as a habit the
deepness and fulness and rhythm of the
Breathing that goes with Happiness, we
are half way towards removing Non-Happiness
and getting Happiness itself.</p>

<p>3. When there is anger or restless
worry, there is, regularly, some muscular
tension. Do away with this, and relax the
muscles—the Art<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a> can be taught and
learnt—and the tendency is for the unsatisfactory<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
feelings themselves to disappear.</p>


<p class="ph3">A Warning about Stimulants with
Re-action</p>

<p>But, in physical “cures,” we often have
to distinguish carefully between the temporary
effects and the ultimate effects.
Too often there is recommended some way
which produces almost immediate exhilaration—or
at least freedom from the sensation
of worry or depression—by driving
toxins etc., which had been in the blood
and had thus tended towards depression,
etc., not out of the body altogether, but
only out of the blood and into the tissues,
where, as Mr. Collings has been able to
prove, they remain stored,<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a> to work mischief<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
in the body and blood and mind in
the future.</p>

<p>The passing sensations of ease, if not of
positive satisfaction, may be brought by
such means as a cup of tea or coffee, some
aspirin, a smoke, a cold bath, and so on.
But this is not an avenue to Happiness.
It is, rather, a patch that crosses the avenue
to Happiness at one point, and then
leaves it again.</p>


<p class="ph3">We Want the Habit of Happiness</p>

<p>What we want is not the flash of Happiness
at heavy expense of future Well-Being
and Happiness, but the habit of
Happiness. We want to keep happy.
We want to sacrifice, if need be, the immediate
present for the lasting future.
As the author of “The Way of the
Servant” says:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span></p>

<p>“<i>I do ask Renunciation of My children—Renunciation
of the less.</i>”</p>

<p>It is not every avenue to Happiness that
is unpleasant at the start. But it is quite
likely that certain treatments—especially
abstinence from or moderation in various
stimulants and narcotics—may be, for a
time, far from producing any Happiness.</p>


<p class="ph3">When You are Happy, be Really Happy</p>

<p>It is well known (see “Alison’s History
of Europe”) that those who have lived for
many years in hot climates are so saturated
with warmth that they keep warm
for some time after they have come into
a cooler climate like ours. Somewhat
similarly, whenever we <i>are</i> happy, if we
let our whole self—every cell and atom
within our body from tip to toe—become
saturated with Happiness whenever we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
feel happy, we should be able to carry on
the habit when the conditions seem less
satisfactory; we should still feel the glow.
But we simply <i>must</i> be and feel happy
“with all our mind and with all our soul
and with all our strength,” at the happy
times. Without feverish excitement, we
should thrill throughout with Happiness,
and be happy “all over,” as someone was
said to smile all over! It is a good phrase.</p>

<p>For why not let all the cells and fibres
enjoy themselves with us? Why keep the
Happiness—as if we were autocratic and
despotic Monarchs, instead of Representatives
of a Democratic Community—to
ourselves? Why not let the cells all “rejoice
with us that rejoice”?</p>

<p>They will repay us a hundredfold in
times of trouble and trial. They will
then thrust back Happiness to us, as the
roots of a plant thrust up stems and leaves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
and flowers in return for the warmth and
light and air and moisture and chemicals
that they have absorbed.</p>

<p>If—as Virchow and many others hold—cells
have some individuality and some
intelligence, will they not respond to our
Happiness, at least as much as you and I
respond to the Happiness of our Nation
and Empire when there is good news and
success of the whole of which we form a
particle?</p>

<p>To enjoy an Environment, or the
memory of it, is a pleasant Avenue. If,
instead of rushing through our sweet holidays
and hours of peace and pleasantness,
we “pause on every charm,” and concentrate
our attention on the Pleasantness,
we can make the Environment, on which
so many people depend for their Health
and Happiness, our own possession,
within our minds, by means of picture-memories,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
or sound-memories, or even
word-memories. Here is one, from J.
Beattie:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“<i>But who the melodies of morn can tell?</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>The wild brook babbling down the mountain-side;</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>The lowing herd, the sheepfold’s simple bell;</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>The pipe of early shepherd dim descried</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>In the low valley; echoing far and wide</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>The clamorous horn along the cliffs above;</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>The hollow murmur of the ocean-tide;</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>The hum of bees, the linnet’s lay of love,</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>And the full choir that wakes the universal grove.</i>”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>After all, what is our real Environment?
Most people would say, at once—the
air, the building, the scenery, in which,
and the people and paraphernalia among<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
which, we happen to be at any time. And
these are indeed part of our Environment.</p>

<p>But our true Environment is, first of
all, the contents of our mind, and especially
that part of the contents—whether memories
or imaginations—to which we give
most attention and interest; secondly, the
Divine influence in which, whether we
recognise it or not, we “live and move and
have our being.”</p>

<p>And, chiefly, we live in whatever we
think of or allow ourselves not to refuse as
residents in our mind.</p>

<p>I have said little, in these few pages,
about what are ordinarily regarded as Environmental
helps. I rather wished to
emphasise the importance of keeping
happy, and of using such means as we had
always or often with us. I could have
written much about colours, music, books,
friendship, and so on. But I had to leave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
unwritten far more than I have written
here.</p>

<p>If these ideas help the reader to keep
happy more consistently, less spasmodically,
and more independently of outside
conditions, they will have served their purpose.</p>

<p>Perhaps even the mere titles of some
books may be of use towards this end—“All’s
Right with the World,” “Just Be
Glad,” and “Keep Happy.”</p>

<p>To keep happy means enjoyment and
ease, peace and poise, health and fitness,
during work-times and non-work times;
it means more work and better work; it
means better opportunities and openings
for our activities in the future; it means
better rest and sleep after work; it means
constant, all-round improvement for oneself
and others. It is, like Health, part of
our duty towards God, our neighbour, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
our self, and the myriads of cell-lives
working within us.</p>


<p class="ph3">A Concluding Suggestion</p>

<p>It is not a bad plan to make a point of
writing down every day (in a note-book,
or on slips of paper) some special reason
why we should keep happy. Mr. Arthur
Knight and I have done this regularly for
many months, and have exchanged our
records from time to time. The following
are a few out of many of our reasons.
They are not arranged in any particular
order, but are put down just as we wrote
them, from day to day. We recommend
every reader to try the practice.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><span class="smcap">Keep Happy.</span> When happiness is
present, the petty things of life fail to disturb
and poison us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Keep Happy.</span> This means living in
the higher part of the mind, where the
air and light and warmth are greater, and
where all good things originate. Keep
your thoughts in this happy region of
yourself, and you will not only get the
right ideas—the ideas that you really
need—but you will draw other minds up
to the same level.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Keep Happy.</span> The more you insist on—and
persist in—keeping happy, the
more you will realise and be convinced
how absolutely and progressively beneficial
Happiness is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Keep Happy</span>, and the things that
would, in the ordinary way, loom large
and important, and upset our peace and
poise, either fade into nothingness or else
become obviously useful as training us to
play the game of life.</p>

<p>If we would be at our best, in body,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
mind, and spirit, we must keep happy.
Gloom and sorrow lessen our power to be
our best and to do our best.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Keep Happy.</span> There is nothing to be
said against it. There is everything to be
said in favour of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Keep Happy.</span> Happiness is as much a
duty towards God, our “Neighbours,” and
ourselves, as is Purity or Kindness or any
other Virtue, and Happiness makes every
other Virtue easier and pleasanter.</p>

<p>However good a physical or mental
“system” you may follow, and however
many excellent rules you may obey as to
diet or exercise, and so on, the rule “Keep
Happy” is found to be a good addition to
your daily régime.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Keep Happy.</span> The happy spirit is a
magnet, and draws all that is most pleasant
and profitable from all sources to seek
you and to become yours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Keep Happy</span> when you are inclined to
be ill-tempered or depressed or anxious.
Then your sight and your perspective will
change, and you will see the good in every
one and every thing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Keep Happy</span>, and give out Happiness.
When we give out Happiness, we always
receive more blessings than we give to
others.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Keep Happy.</span> Difficulties and troubles
enlarge through unhappiness, which is
their fertilising manure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Keep Happy.</span> To keep happy is good
and God-like.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Keep Happy.</span> Whoever is happy,
longs and tends to make all others happier
and happier.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Keep Happy.</span> To keep happy is true
heroism—no less so than any spasmodic
act of courage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Keep Happy.</span> Then every good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
quality within you will grow and flourish
and multiply and radiate.</p>
